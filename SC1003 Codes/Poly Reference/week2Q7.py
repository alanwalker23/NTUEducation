"From Question"
r = 0
PI = 3.14159
# Formula for the circumference of a circle given its radius
c = 2 * PI * r
# Get the radius from the user
r = float(input("Please enter the circle's radius: "))
# Print the circumference
print("Circumference is", c)



'''Part A Answer : This is because the variable r is set to 0, hence the circumference would be 0.
Moreover, the sequence of the codes are wrong, the input for r should go first instead of calculating the circumference.'''


"""Part B Answer : The line r = 0 [line 2] should be replaced with line r = float(input("Please enter the circle's radius: ")) [Line 7]"""


'''Part C Answer : 
# Get the radius from the user
r = float(input("Please enter the circle's radius: ")) 
# Formula for the circumference of a circle given its radius
PI = 3.14159
c = 2 * PI * r
# Print the circumference
print("Circumference is", c)
